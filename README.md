# Web Data Analytics Project

## Motivation
Throughout our time at Purdue University, we have read multiple papers that cite ride-sharing services as threats to car ownership. We want to test if this is truly the case.

## Code 
We used R as our coding language to perform hypothesis testing and develop linear regression models.

## Data 
Our data was compiled after web-scraping from government sites. It is attached in a CSV.
